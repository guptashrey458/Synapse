# Task 2 Implementation Summary

## Completed: Core Data Models and Validation

### Sub-task 2.1: Scenario and Entity Data Models ✅

**Implemented:**
- `ValidatedEntity` class with comprehensive validation for all entity types
- `ValidatedDisruptionScenario` class with validation and utility methods
- `EntityExtractor` utility class for extracting entities from natural language text

**Key Features:**
- **Entity Validation**: Format validation for delivery IDs, phone numbers, addresses
- **Scenario Classification**: Automatic classification into traffic, merchant, address, or multi-factor scenarios
- **Urgency Detection**: Automatic urgency level determination based on text keywords
- **Entity Extraction**: Regex-based extraction of delivery IDs, phone numbers, addresses, merchants, and person names
- **Utility Methods**: Get entities by type, find primary entities, extract delivery IDs

**Entity Types Supported:**
- Delivery IDs (format: DEL123456, ORD789012, etc.)
- Phone numbers (various formats)
- Addresses (street addresses)
- Merchants (keyword-based detection)
- Person names (capitalized word pairs)
- Time references

### Sub-task 2.2: Reasoning and Plan Data Structures ✅

**Implemented:**
- `ToolAction` class for representing tool calls within reasoning steps
- `ToolResult` class for capturing tool execution results
- `ValidatedReasoningStep` class with tool result tracking
- `ValidatedReasoningTrace` class for complete reasoning workflows
- `ValidatedPlanStep` class with dependency management and status tracking
- `AlternativePlan` class for representing alternative solutions
- `ValidatedResolutionPlan` class with plan execution tracking
- `ValidatedResolutionResult` class for complete resolution outcomes

**Key Features:**
- **Serialization**: All classes support to_dict/from_dict for JSON serialization
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all data structures
- **Status Tracking**: Plan steps can be marked as pending, in_progress, completed, or failed
- **Dependency Management**: Plan steps can depend on completion of earlier steps
- **Tool Integration**: Reasoning steps can track multiple tool results
- **Progress Tracking**: Plans can calculate completion percentage and identify next steps
- **Alternative Plans**: Support for multiple solution approaches with trade-off analysis

**Plan Management Features:**
- Get next executable steps based on dependencies
- Calculate completion percentage
- Track actual vs estimated durations
- Identify critical path through plan
- Support for alternative solution strategies

## Testing

**Comprehensive Test Suite:**
- 55 unit tests covering all classes and methods
- Validation testing for all error conditions
- Serialization/deserialization testing
- Entity extraction accuracy testing
- Scenario classification testing
- Plan execution workflow testing

**Test Coverage:**
- Entity validation and extraction
- Scenario creation and classification
- Tool action and result handling
- Reasoning step management
- Plan step dependencies and status
- Complete workflow serialization

## Requirements Satisfied

**Requirement 1.2**: ✅ System extracts and identifies delivery-related entities (addresses, merchant names, delivery IDs)
**Requirement 1.3**: ✅ System requests clarification when scenario description is ambiguous or incomplete (through validation)
**Requirement 3.1**: ✅ System outputs transparent chain-of-thought showing each reasoning step
**Requirement 4.1**: ✅ System generates coherent multi-step resolution plans
**Requirement 4.4**: ✅ System estimates expected resolution time and success probability

## Files Created/Modified

1. `src/agent/models.py` - Enhanced data models with validation
2. `tests/test_models.py` - Comprehensive unit tests
3. `src/agent/__init__.py` - Updated exports

## Usage Example

```python
from src.agent import EntityExtractor, ValidatedDisruptionScenario

# Extract entities and create scenario from text
extractor = EntityExtractor()
scenario = extractor.create_scenario_from_text(
    "Pizza Palace at 123 Main Street is overloaded, delivery DEL123456 is urgent"
)

print(f"Scenario type: {scenario.scenario_type.value}")
print(f"Urgency: {scenario.urgency_level.value}")
print(f"Entities found: {len(scenario.entities)}")

# Get specific entity types
addresses = scenario.get_entities_by_type(EntityType.ADDRESS)
delivery_ids = scenario.get_delivery_ids()
```

The implementation provides a solid foundation for the autonomous delivery coordinator with robust data validation, entity extraction, and plan management capabilities.
