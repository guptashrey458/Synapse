# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Autonomous Delivery Coordinator is an AI-powered agent that intelligently resolves complex last-mile delivery disruptions in real-time. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, this agent uses human-like reasoning to analyze disruption scenarios, gather information through digital tools, and formulate coherent multi-step resolution plans. The system accepts natural language descriptions of delivery problems and provides transparent chain-of-thought reasoning while autonomously coordinating solutions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a logistics operator, I want the system to accept disruption scenarios in natural language, so that I can quickly input complex delivery problems without needing to format them in a specific way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs a disruption scenario in natural language THEN the system SHALL parse and understand the scenario context
2. WHEN the input contains delivery-related entities (addresses, merchant names, delivery IDs) THEN the system SHALL extract and identify these key components
3. WHEN the scenario description is ambiguous or incomplete THEN the system SHALL request clarification from the user
4. WHEN the input is received THEN the system SHALL acknowledge receipt and begin processing within 2 seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a logistics operator, I want the agent to intelligently select and use appropriate tools to gather information, so that it can make informed decisions about how to resolve delivery disruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a disruption scenario THEN the system SHALL identify which tools are relevant to the specific problem type
2. WHEN multiple tools could provide useful information THEN the system SHALL prioritize tools based on the scenario context
3. WHEN a tool call fails or returns incomplete data THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative tools or approaches
4. WHEN using tools THEN the system SHALL make API calls to simulated logistics services (traffic, merchant status, address validation, etc.)
5. WHEN tool responses are received THEN the system SHALL integrate the information into its reasoning process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logistics operator, I want to see the agent's complete reasoning process, so that I can understand how it arrived at its solution and trust its recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a disruption scenario THEN the system SHALL output a transparent chain-of-thought showing each reasoning step
2. WHEN making tool calls THEN the system SHALL explain why each tool was selected and what information it expects to gather
3. WHEN receiving tool responses THEN the system SHALL describe how the new information affects its understanding of the problem
4. WHEN formulating a solution plan THEN the system SHALL explain the logic behind each step in the plan
5. WHEN the reasoning process is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a clear summary of the final resolution strategy

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a logistics operator, I want the agent to create actionable multi-step resolution plans, so that delivery disruptions can be systematically resolved with clear next steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a disruption scenario has been analyzed THEN the system SHALL generate a coherent multi-step resolution plan
2. WHEN creating the plan THEN the system SHALL prioritize actions based on urgency and impact on delivery success
3. WHEN the plan involves multiple stakeholders THEN the system SHALL specify who should perform each action and when
4. WHEN alternative solutions exist THEN the system SHALL present the primary plan and note viable alternatives
5. WHEN the plan is complete THEN the system SHALL estimate the expected resolution time and success probability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the agent to successfully handle diverse disruption scenarios, so that it can be relied upon for various types of delivery problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN presented with traffic-related disruptions THEN the system SHALL successfully devise logical resolution plans
2. WHEN presented with merchant availability issues THEN the system SHALL successfully devise logical resolution plans
3. WHEN presented with address or location problems THEN the system SHALL successfully devise logical resolution plans
4. WHEN presented with complex multi-factor disruptions THEN the system SHALL successfully devise logical resolution plans
5. WHEN handling any scenario THEN the system SHALL demonstrate coherent reasoning that leads to actionable solutions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be implemented as a command-line application, so that it can be easily tested and integrated into existing logistics workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is launched THEN the system SHALL provide a clear command-line interface for inputting scenarios
2. WHEN processing scenarios THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress and reasoning steps in the terminal
3. WHEN a scenario is resolved THEN the system SHALL output the complete solution in a structured, readable format
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions
5. WHEN the application exits THEN the system SHALL clean up resources and provide a summary of the session

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want access to simulated logistics tools, so that the agent can interact with realistic delivery system APIs during development and testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs traffic information THEN it SHALL have access to a check_traffic() tool that returns realistic traffic data
2. WHEN the system needs merchant information THEN it SHALL have access to a get_merchant_status() tool that returns merchant availability
3. WHEN the system needs address validation THEN it SHALL have access to address verification tools
4. WHEN the system needs delivery tracking THEN it SHALL have access to shipment status tools
5. WHEN tools are called THEN they SHALL return structured data that mimics real-world API responses
